# From Zero to GenLayer  
### Building an AI Dispute Resolver with Intelligent Contracts

This repository contains a beginner-friendly, hands-on tutorial designed to take a newcomer **from zero knowledge of GenLayer** to building a simple working GenLayer dApp.

The tutorial walks through GenLayer’s core concepts and tooling by building a minimal **AI-powered dispute resolution dApp** using:
- GenLayer Studio
- Python Intelligent Contracts
- Optimistic Democracy Consensus
- The Equivalence Principle
- A simple frontend using `genlayer-js`

The goal is not to build a production-ready application, but to **learn how GenLayer works by building something real**.

## Why GenLayer?

Traditional blockchains execute deterministic smart contracts.  
They are excellent at handling strict rules but struggle with:
- Natural language agreements  
- Subjective decisions  
- Context-based reasoning  
- Real-world ambiguity  

GenLayer introduces **Intelligent Contracts** — contracts that can reason using AI models and reach consensus through a novel mechanism called **Optimistic Democracy**.

This tutorial explains these ideas in a practical way.

---

## What We Will Build

We will build a **simple dispute resolution MVP**:

- Two parties submit a dispute described in natural language
- An Intelligent Contract evaluates the dispute
- AI validators reason about the input
- GenLayer reaches consensus on a verdict
- The decision and reasoning are returned to the user

This use case is intentionally simple but showcases what makes GenLayer unique.

---

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes **no prior GenLayer experience**.

You will need:
- Git
- Node.js (LTS)
- Docker Desktop (with WSL2 enabled on Windows)
- Python 3.10+

## Part 1: Setting Up GenLayer Studio

In this section, we:
- Clone the GenLayer simulator
- Install dependencies
- Run GenLayer Studio locally
- Explore the Studio interface

GenLayer Studio allows us to simulate the GenLayer network and test Intelligent Contracts safely.

> Common issue: Docker must be running before starting the simulator.

---

## Part 2: Understanding Optimistic Democracy & the Equivalence Principle

### Optimistic Democracy (Intuitive Explanation)

Instead of assuming contracts always execute correctly, GenLayer:
- Assumes validators agree by default
- Allows challenges when validators disagree
- Uses AI reasoning to resolve disagreements

This makes it suitable for subjective decisions like disputes.

### Equivalence Principle

All AI validators are treated as equals.
No single model has absolute authority.
Consensus emerges from collective reasoning.

In our dispute resolver, this means:
- The decision is not based on one AI response
- Multiple perspectives contribute to the final verdict

---

## Part 3: Writing Our First Intelligent Contract (Python)

We write a Python-based Intelligent Contract that:
- Accepts dispute text as input
- Applies simple reasoning logic
- Returns a verdict and explanation

This contract runs inside the GenLayer environment and participates in consensus.

The focus here is **clarity**, not complexity.

---

## Part 4: Running the Contract in GenLayer Studio

Using GenLayer Studio, we:
- Deploy the Intelligent Contract
- Provide sample dispute inputs
- Observe how decisions are produced
- Inspect reasoning output

This step makes GenLayer concepts tangible.

---

## Part 5: Building a Simple Frontend with genlayer-js

To complete the dApp:
- We create a minimal frontend
- Use `genlayer-js` to interact with the contract
- Submit disputes from the UI
- Display the resulting decision and reasoning

The frontend is intentionally simple and focuses on interaction, not design.

---

## Part 6: Testing the Dispute Resolver

We test:
- Different dispute descriptions
- Edge cases
- How changes in input affect outcomes

This helps understand how Intelligent Contracts behave in practice.

---

## What You Learned

By completing this tutorial, you will have:
- Run GenLayer Studio locally
- Understood Optimistic Democracy and the Equivalence Principle
- Written a Python Intelligent Contract
- Connected a frontend using genlayer-js
- Built a complete GenLayer dApp from scratch

---

## Next Steps

Possible extensions:
- Add multiple validators
- Introduce staking or incentives
- Expand dispute logic
- Build more advanced GenLayer applications

GenLayer enables many new types of applications that were not possible with traditional smart contracts.
